# What is this?

What you see is a repository of my solution for task no. 5. of the [Introduction to Programming, Functional Approach (pol. Wstęp do Programowania, Podejście Funkcyjne / WPF)](https://usosweb.mimuw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=1000-211bWPF) course offered by the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw (further referred to as "MIM UW") in the 2021/2022 winter semester.

# Brief descriptions

## Task 1 - Arithmetic
The task was to write a library of arithmetic operations performed on approximate values (ones encumbered with measurement errors) represented as intervals.
## Task 2 - Priority Queue
The task was to implement a joinable priority queue based on [leftist trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leftist_tree).
## Task 3 - Integer Set
The task was to implement a libary of integer sets as [AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree), where each node contains an interval of values.
## Task 4 - Origami
The task was to write a library of "origami" operations (folds) on a structure representing a sheet of paper. 
## Task 5 - Topological Sort
The task was to write a function performing [topological sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) of a graph.
## Task 6 - Decanting Puzzle
The task was to write a function solving a [decanting puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pouring_puzzle). Its partial results were represented as a graph scanned with [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).
